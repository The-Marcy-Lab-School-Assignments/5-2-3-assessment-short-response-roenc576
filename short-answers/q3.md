# Question

When is a closure created?

# Answer
A closure is created a function (object?) references a variable in its outer scope. 

For instance, in the following example the functions `addFriend` and `getFriends` refer to the `friends` array which is in the outer function `makeFriendsManager`. Closures is just one way to prevent people from accessing private values directly.  

```js
const makeFriendsManager = () => {
  // this variable is in the "outer" function
  // and referenced in addFriend and getFriends
  const friends = [];

  const friendsManager = {
    addFriend(newFriend) {
      if (typeof newFriend !== 'string') return;
      friends.push(newFriend);
    }
    getFriends() {
      return [...friends]; 
    },
  }
  return friendsManager;
}
```
