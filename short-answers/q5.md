# Question

What are the goals of encapsulation?

# Answer
The goal of encapsulation is to ensure that you're separating state from functionality. It's important if you want to create a consistent and predictable interface. 

If you don't separate the two, it can make reusing your functions/components more difficult and your code will quickly become unmanageable as you add a bunch of features to it. 

Also, the more consistent and predictable an interface the easier it is to test when something goes wrong.
