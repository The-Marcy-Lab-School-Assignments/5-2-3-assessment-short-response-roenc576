# Question

Which of the following functions demonstrates closure? Explain why.

```js
const printAll = (words) => {
  words.forEach((word) => console.log(word));
}

const multiplyAll = (nums, multiplier) => {
  return nums.map((num) => num * multiplier);
}
```

# Answer
The `multiplyAll` function demonstrates closure because the callback function `(num) => num * multiplier)` is referencing `multiplier` which is outside of its scope.

Additionally, `multiplyAll` returns a new array; the function isn't changing `nums` directly. Each time `multiplyAll` is invoked, it will return a new array.
