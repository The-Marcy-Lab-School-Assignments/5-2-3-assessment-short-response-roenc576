# Question

What is polymorphism? 
Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
Polymorphism means "many forms" and it's the idea that a class's names for its methods and properties can be shared among other classes but be implemented differently. 

In the following example, the Creature class can have other signatures for different kinds of creature: 

```js
class Creature {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.friends = [];
  }
  makeFriend(friend) {
    this.friends.push(friend)
    console.log(`Hai ${friend}!!! My name is ${this.name}. So glad to have a new friend :>>>`);
  }
}

class Moth extends Creature {
  
  makeFriend(friend) {
    this.friends.push(friend);
    console.log('*flap flap flap*');
  }
}

class WolfSpider extends Creature {
  constructor(name, instrument) {
    super(name);
    this.prey = prey;
  }
  makeFriend(friend) { // Method Override
    super.makeFriend(friend)
    console.log(`I like to eat ${this.prey}. Would you like to hunt them with me?`);
  }
}
```
